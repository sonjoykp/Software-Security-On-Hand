## Attack Categories

### Malware Analysis
- **Malware Analysis:** Analyze malware samples using both static and dynamic techniques to understand their behavior and methods.

### Buffer Overflow and Return Oriented Programming (ROP) Attacks
Demonstrates classical memory corruption techniques used to compromise applications.
- **Buffer Overflow:** Exploit vulnerabilities by overflowing memory buffers.
- **Return-to-libc Attack:** Use standard library functions to execute malicious code.
- **Finding ROP Gadgets:** Techniques to identify useful ROP gadgets in binaries.
- **Return-Oriented Programming:** Construct and execute ROP chains for arbitrary code execution.

### Semantic Attacks
Focus on exploiting vulnerabilities that arise from high-level semantic errors.
- **Format String Vulnerability:** Exploit vulnerabilities due to improper format string usage.
- **RSA Attacks:** Exploit weaknesses in RSA implementations.
  - **Common Modulus Attack:** Demonstrate exploitation when RSA implementations share a common modulus.
  - **Power Analysis Attack:** Use power consumption analysis to extract cryptographic keys.

### Testing
Techniques for automated vulnerability discovery and validation.
- **Fuzz Testing:** 
  - **A Simple Program Fuzzing:** Basic fuzzing strategies applied to simple programs.
  - **The OpenSSL "HeartBleed" Fuzzing:** Recreate fuzzing scenarios related to the HeartBleed vulnerability.
  - **Invariant Checking:** Validate program invariants to detect hidden bugs.
- **Symbolic Execution:**
  - **Trying Angr for Symbolic Execution:** Leverage Angr to explore program execution paths.
  - **Injecting Path Constraints:** Apply path constraints to guide symbolic execution and expose vulnerabilities.
