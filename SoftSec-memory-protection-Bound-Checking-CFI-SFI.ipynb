In this exercise, we will ask you to implement the checking logics of these mitigations, **without** dealing with the hassle of static analysis and binary instrumentation. We will start with building an **offline** reference monitor to track all the memory traces and control transfers, and then implement the checking logics corresponding to bounds checking, CFI, and SFI."

        "In this step, we will start by collecting the traces of memory access (read and write) and control transfer (call, jump, and return) in a program. Normally, a reference monitor will collect and check the traces online during the program execution. This is important as any operations violating the safety policies will have to be interrupted immediately. However, performing online checks require instrumentation and lots of optimizations to avoid significant overheads. Instead, in this exercise, we will design an **offline** reference monitor, which checks the traces **after** the program execution is finished.\n",
